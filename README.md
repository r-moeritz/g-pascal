This is the source code to G-Pascal, A Pascal compiler for the
Commodore 64 by Nick Gammon, converted to ca65 assembler format by
Chris Baird.

My contribution has been to create a Makefile that builds the code,
crunches the resulting PRG with Exomizer, and produces a D64 image
that includes a demo and the 'Sub Hunt' game. I've also taken the
liberty of including here some original materials from [Nick Gammon's
website](https://www.gammon.com.au/GPascal/) incl.

- A scan of the original user manual
- A scan of an article from the August 1982 edition of "Your Computer"
  magazine in which Nick explains how to build a text adventure using
  G-Pascal
- A scan of an original advertisement for G-Pascal
- Original D64 disk images of G-Pascal v3.1
- A text file written by Nick in which he explains how the original
  source code of G-Pascal was organized

Enjoy!
